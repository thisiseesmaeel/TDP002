# TDP002 - Imperative Programming

The course introduces the education Innovative Programming. In the course we take a close look at the principles of basic programming, specifically imperative programming. We use the dynamically typed programming language Python in this course. Python is easy to get started with and therefore fits well in this introductory course.

The course is taught in parallel with the first project course, which also uses Python. Therefore, it is especially important that you work intensively from the beginning of the course, so that you can keep up with the project course as well.
